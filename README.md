=============
Investigate and tell the assessor how these might help groups of coders to manage their projects.

The presentation needs to be done in one week. Presentations will take 15 min per group, with an extra 5 minutes for the group to take questions. The tutor may choose to shorten this time if there are many groups in your tutorial.


What to investigate

We're not looking for complex code here. Just create enough code to print an interesting welcome message. The aim of this assignment is to show us that you understand how these sites can help software group work.

We want to see that everyone in your group has participated to add information to the project. For example: edited the small piece of code, added some documentation, created a README file, uploaded a screenshot, decided on a code license, listed some possible bugs, updated a project web page, created and used a project mailing list to chat between group members.

Compare and contrast the different features offered on different project hosting sites. Which features are the most important? Which are the easiest to use? Which have the most documentation? Which features are missing that you would like to see?
Group Working

We suggest that you begin by deciding who will be in charge of what in the group. Some people might be better at doing the research, some the presentation, some keeping people to schedule, and some the demonstrating.
The presentation

The presentation will describe what you have learned, and demonstrate how you have built your small online project. All group members should be involved and end up able to understand the group presentation. Your presentation should acknowledge who did what.

Each person in the group should give part of the presentation. Remember that you will need a link person to do the introduction and handle the slides for the team.
